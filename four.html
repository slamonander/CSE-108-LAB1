        <h3>KENDRICK: NOT LIKE US</h3>
        <p><b>NOT LIKE US:</b> On May 4th, Kendrick releases his last track "Not Like Us", intensifying his accusations against Drake and 
        his record label for being involved in pedophilia and child sexual abuse. He also goes to double down on Drake doing cultural appropriation 
    and exploiting Atlanta artists for credibility and financial gain. The cover art of the song shows Drake's residence with "sex-offender map symbols".</p>

    <h3>DRAKE: THE HEART PT. 6</h3>
    <p><b>THE HEART PT. 6:</b> On May 5th, Drake releases his last track "The Heart Pt. 6" with the title used as a shot against Kendrick and his song titles 
    that uses "The Heart Part (1-5)". Drake addresses the allegations of domestic violence against Kendrick, implies Dave Free is the father to one of Whitney's child, 
denies the previous accusations of pedophilia, and claims that his group has planted stories to bait Kendrick. He also accuses Kendrick and his "sexual trauma" of being molested 
as the reason for Kendrick accusing Drake of pedophilia. (Note: In Mr. Morale, Kendrick has talked about generational trauma and delves into his mother's trauma of being molested, 
which Drake tries referring to but mistakens Kendrick as the victim).</p>
