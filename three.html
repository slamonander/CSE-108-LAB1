        <h3>DRAKE: FAMILY MATTERS</h3>
        <p><b>FAMILY MATTERS:</b> On May 3rd, Drake releases "Family Matters", targeting Kendrick Lamar and other rappers such as 
        Future, Rick Ross, A$SAP Rocky, etc. In the track, Drake alleges Kendrick committing domestic violence against his partner 
    Whitney Alford, and that there is infidelity between Whitney and Kendrick's creative partner, Dave Free. Drake also goes to 
suggest that one of Kendrick's children isn't his.</p>

        <h3>KENDRICK: MEET THE GRAHAMS</h3>
        <p><b>MEET THE GRAHAMS:</b> On May 3rd, 20 minutes after Drake's "Family Matters", Kendrick releases "Meet the Grahams". 
        In the track, Kendrick fires at Drake in scalding criticism, accusing Drake of parental neglect, sexual exploitation, running a 
    sex trafficking ring, and for being a sexual predator. He also accuses Drake of abandoning his 11 year old daughter. Throughout the song, 
Kendrick also addresses to Drake's family such as his mother, son, father, and alleged daughter. The cover image of the song reveals several of 
Drake's belongings such as a shirt, gloves, prescription medications under Drake's real name, and shopping receipts.</p>
