        <h3>KENDRICK: 6:16 IN LA (A WARNING SHOT)</h3>
        <p><b>6:16 IN LA:</b> Kendrick Lamar releases "6:16 in LA" on Instagram on May 3rd, targeting Drake and Drake's record label, OVO Sound. 
        He hints that there are secret alliances working with Kendrick and against Drake. Kendrick also mocks Drake's reliance on internet 
    culture. Kendrick also follows up with a picture of a Maybach Glove, later revealed that it belonged to Drake, which suggests Kendrick's 
    earlier suggestions of internal betrayal amongst Drake's group. 
    This track has also been interpreted by the audience as a "warning shot" by Kendrick for Drake.</p>
