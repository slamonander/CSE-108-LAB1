        <p>- TAYLOR MADE FREESTYLE + PUSH UPS <i>VS.</i> EUPHORIA </p>

        <h3>introduction</h3>
        <p>Arguably, the rap battle between Kendrick Lamar and Drake has started when Drake and J. Cole's First Person Shooter was released 
            on (10/31/2023), which takes a jab at Kendrick Lamar. This song release led to Kendrick's feature on "Like That" with Future and 
            Metro Boomin where Kendrick takes a jab at both Drake and J. Cole.</p>
        <p>But, this website will cover the timeline starting from April 2024 instead of going all the way back to 2023.</p>

        <h3>DRAKE: PUSH UPS AND TAYLOR MADE</h3>
        <p><b>PUSH UPS:</b> Drake dropped a track, "Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50)" that targets Kendrick, Future, the Weeknd, J. Cole, Rick Ross, etc. The song 
            was leaked on April 13th and has been officially released on April 19th.
        </p>
        <p><b>TAYLOR MADE FREESTYLE:</b> Following "Push Ups", Drake releases "Taylor Made" on April 19th, featuring AI-generated voices of Tupac and Snoop Dogg to target Kendrick Lamar. 
        The song disses Kendrick for his slow response to Drake's songs while criticizing Drake and encouraging Lamar (whether or not it was in a satirical way). The song 
    has been removed after Tupac's estate filed a cease-and-desist on Drake.</p>
        
        <h3>KENDRICK: EUPHORIA</h3>
        <p><b>EUPHORIA:</b> Kendrick Lamar responds with "Euphoria" on April 30th, targeting Drake on many different points. Kendrick criticizes Drake as a manipulative man,
         exploiting the culture for his own benefits, and questions the authenticity of his narratives. He also questions Drake and his parental responsibilities and relationships 
        with his family.</p>
